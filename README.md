# Gimme My Stuff Back #

Brought to you by [AppsAttic.com](http://appsattic.com).

(Note: Even though I'm quite full on saying "Get you your Stuff Back", "What is Rightly Yours" or "Get What You
Deserve", it's actually more peaceful than that. I like a lot of these services - I just want to make sure I have
what's mine if something happens to them.)

## Quick Start ##

    $ git clone git://github.com/appsattic/gimme-my-stuff-back.git
    $ cd gimme-my-stuff-back
    $ npm -d install

Then you can either run a command line to get your stuff back:

    $ node gimme-my-stuff-back.js Amazon S3
    ...etc...
    $ node gimme-my-stuff-back.js Twitter Twitter
    ...etc...
    $ node gimme-my-stuff-back.js Yahoo Contacts
    ...etc...

Or run a server in which you can click around and get what is rightly yours:

    $ node server.js
    Listening on http://localhost:8080/ ... visit that address in your browser!
